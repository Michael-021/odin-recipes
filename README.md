# Odin-Recipes Project

This is the first project in the foundations course of [_The Odin Project_](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes). The goal of this project is to apply HTML concepts to create a basic recipies website. This project helps to demonstrate how links work, how to create and push to a git repository, writing commit messages, and linking images from the web.
